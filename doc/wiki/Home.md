Welcome to the `vg` wiki!

**In a hurry? Check our [[Quickstart]] guide.**

Variation graphs are powerful objects capable of describing populations of genomes. `vg` provides a set of tools to construct, manipulate, and visualize them in the context of genome informatics.

Please feel free to edit and extend this wiki! For any questions or concerns please use the issues page in this repository, or drop by [the vg chat on gitter](https://gitter.im/vgteam/vg) or irc (#vg in freenode).
